# File renamer

With this program you can rename a bunch of files at the same time. You can add files with the `file` menu or `drag and drop` them in the list view. 
The renaming process is done in this order:

1. Name
2. Replace (name)
3. Remove (name)
4. Add (name)
5. Extension

When you use option, you can see the new name and extension in the list view at the collumn `New name` and `New ext.`
